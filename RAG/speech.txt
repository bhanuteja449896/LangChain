India and Russia maintain a close and long-standing strategic partnership rooted in historical ties dating back to the Soviet era, when diplomatic relations were established in April 1947, shortly before India's independence.
 This relationship evolved into a "special and preferential strategic partnership" following the signing of the Declaration on Strategic Partnership in 2000, which marked a significant milestone in bilateral ties.
 The partnership is built on five key pillars: politics, defence, civil nuclear energy, anti-terrorism cooperation, and space exploration.

Defence cooperation has been a cornerstone of the relationship. Russia has historically been India's largest supplier of military equipment, accounting for approximately 68% of Indiaâ€™s defence imports in 2017.
 While the relationship began as a buyer-seller model, it has expanded to include joint research, development, and production of advanced systems such as the BrahMos cruise missile and the licensed production of T-90 tanks and SU-30 aircraft in India.
 Although India withdrew from the joint Fifth Generation Fighter Aircraft (FGFA) project with Russia in 2018, collaboration in defence technology continues.
